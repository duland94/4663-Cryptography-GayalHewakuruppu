## Assignment 7 - Finding Primes
## Author - Gayal Hewakuruppu

### Introduction
A primality test, like the name suggests, is a test to determine if a number is prime or not. It is different from factorization 
because it does not factor the given number.

### Main Categories
Primality tests can be divided under three main catogories.
1) Certification
2) Compositeness
3) Deterministic

### Deterministic
Like the name suggests, deterministic tests will determine if a number is prime or not. The accuracy of these tests are a 100%.
The Lucas-Lehmer test and elliptic curve primality proving are two examples of deterministic primality tests.
